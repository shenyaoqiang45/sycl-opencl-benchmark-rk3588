# Test Images

Place your test images here for benchmarking.

The benchmark currently generates synthetic test images automatically,
but you can modify the code to load real images from this directory.

## Image Format
The current implementation expects RGB float images in memory.
Each pixel has 3 channels (R, G, B) with values in the range [0.0, 1.0].
